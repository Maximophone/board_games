  <section id="turn-structure">
    <h2>Turn Structure</h2>
    <p>Each turn consists of four phases:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Allocation Phase</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Players allocate their available employee tokens among the different departments.</li>
          <li>Note: One employee token cannot be split between multiple departments.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Action Phase</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Players may play any number of Special Action cards from their hand.</li>
          <li>Includes playing an "Espionage" card, which — if successful — disrupts a chosen department in the opponent's corporation for the current turn. (See Espionage section for details.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Execution Phase</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Roll a die for the overall market demand for the current turn. Add 2 for each "Market Research" card in play.</li>
          <li>For each department where they have employee tokens, players roll a 6-sided die per employee:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Production: On a 4-6, gain a product token.</li>
            <li>Research: On a 4-6, draw a special action card. If there is no card left in the pile, the discard is shuffled and becomes the new pile.</li>
            <li>HR: On a 4-6, gain a new employee token, if desired.</li>
            <li>Sales: On a 4-6, sell a product for 3 money tokens, up to the overall market demand. For example if the demand is 2, each player can sell at most two products. The products sold are discarded.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>When an "Improved Methods" card is placed on a department, it is upgraded, lowering the success roll threshold (from 4-6 to 3-6, 3-6 to 2-6, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Economic Upkeep Phase</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Players must pay 1 money token per 3 employees for upkeep costs.</li>
          <li>Players must pay 1 money token per 6 products they have for storage costs.</li>
          <li>If a player cannot afford upkeep for all their employees, they must let one go.</li>
          <li>Players can fire any number of employees if they wish to</li>
          <li>At the end of the turn, players can have a maximum of 5 cards in their hand. They discard any additional card of their choosing.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
      <li>Players may bluff that they have an Espionage card, even if they don't.</li>
      <li>To play Espionage, place a card face-down and target a department.</li>
      <li>The targeted player can either call the bluff or accept the sabotage. If they accept, the sabotage is successful and the face-down card is discarded.</li>
      <li>If a bluff is called and revealed:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If it's an Espionage card, the defender loses an employee token in the targeted department and the sabotage is successful.</li>
          <li>If it's not an Espionage card, the attacker rolls a die and loses that amount of money. If they can't pay, they lose an employee token.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
